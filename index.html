<p>As a whole we tend to treat new mediums in the manner we handle the most closely related existing familiar medium. Such was the case with the web being treated like paper.In reality the web is constantly <s>changing</s> evolving, and we as designers should do our best to compliment this attribute of the web. <b>Content must come first, and accessibility with adaptability must be emphasized explicitly.</b></p>
</main>


<p class="full">Traditionally designers used <abbr title="hyperstext markup language">HTML</abbr> to create web pages, but now HTML is used for the frame work of a page and <abbr title="cascading style sheets">CSS</abbr> to suggest the appearance. By doing this it allows for the web browsers to read, and display the web pages even if there are elements or aspects that are not recognized. The advantage in designing web pages this way is increased functionality across different browsers, operating systems, and devices. Not everyone has optimal vision, and some may need to increase font size to read web pages. Some may be color blind, and need the emphasized words to read as emphasized without with use of color. A good way to remember this is that function is more important than aesthetic.</p>

<p class="full">Throughout the article, Allsopp give a few tips to the reader on what can be done to increase the adaptability and accessibility of web pages. The most important in these tips is for designers to stop trying to “control” the web, rather let the web respond to direction. Avoid absolute values, such as point size for fonts, instead let the viewer changes the font to the appropriate size for their needs. If a specific size difference between a header, footer, or body text is desired try using proportional sizing. Proportional sizing methods can be used to suggest the size of margins, and images also. If a designer is still concerned about “exactly how” a page look then they have not yet grasped this concept.</p>
